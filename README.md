# Hospital Management System (HMS)

A comprehensive, multi-user Hospital Management System designed to streamline hospital operations, from patient management to administrative oversight. This project features a robust role-based access control system, serving Super Admins, Branch Admins, Receptionists, and Online Users (Patients) through a modern, decoupled architecture.

The system is built with a **Spring Boot REST API** backend and a separate **HTML, Bootstrap, and JavaScript (AJAX/Fetch)** frontend, ensuring a modular and scalable solution.
